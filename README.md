TEST
- I've tried to keep the solution as simple as possible (not used Repository pattern cause I used EF InMemory)
- I focused my solution on using a clean architecture, services approach, KISS, Entity Framework

MISSING PARTS
--- Proper unit tests of all the methods, including controllers and services
--- Proper validation of some of the functions

HOW TO TEST
- A Postman collection has been created to test it (included in the solution)

Any question is more than welcomed.
